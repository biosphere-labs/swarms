# Task: CriticalPathScheduler — Execution ordering and parallel grouping

## Description
Implement the CriticalPathScheduler that takes a sub-task graph and determines optimal execution order to minimize wall-clock time. Groups independent sub-tasks for parallel execution and respects dependency edges.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CriticalPathScheduler class with `schedule(sub_task_graph) -> ExecutionPlan` method
- [ ] ExecutionPlan contains ordered list of parallel cohorts (groups that run simultaneously)
- [ ] Respects dependency edges: dependent tasks wait for prerequisites
- [ ] Identifies critical path: the longest chain of dependent tasks
- [ ] Handles DAG validation: detects circular dependencies
- [ ] Provides estimated wall-clock stages (number of sequential rounds)

## Technical Details
- File: `swarms/structs/critical_path_scheduler.py`
- Uses networkx (already in framework dependencies) for DAG operations
- Topological sort for ordering
- Critical path = longest path in weighted DAG
- ExecutionPlan: list of CohortGroup, each containing sub-task IDs that can run in parallel
- Implements CriticalSteps metric: `CriticalSteps = sum_t(S_main(t) + max_i S_sub,i(t))`

## Dependencies
- [ ] networkx (already included in framework)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 5-8
- Parallel: true (no dependencies on other new modules)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Correctly groups independent tasks into parallel cohorts
- [ ] Detects and rejects circular dependencies
- [ ] Critical path calculation matches expected results
