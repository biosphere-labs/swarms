# Task: Decomposition and synthesis prompts

## Description
Create the prompt templates used by DecompositionEngine and ResultAggregator for LLM-based task analysis and result synthesis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `parl_decomposition.py` prompt: instructs LLM to analyze a task and output structured JSON sub-task graph
- [ ] `parl_synthesis.py` prompt: instructs LLM to merge sub-agent results, flag contradictions, identify gaps
- [ ] Decomposition prompt includes examples of good decomposition patterns
- [ ] Synthesis prompt includes instructions for contradiction handling (surface, don't resolve)
- [ ] Both prompts follow existing framework prompt patterns (string constants)

## Technical Details
- Files: `swarms/prompts/parl_decomposition.py`, `swarms/prompts/parl_synthesis.py`
- Follow existing prompt file patterns in swarms/prompts/ (e.g., AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_V2 style)
- Decomposition prompt output format: JSON with parallel_groups, dependencies, sub-task descriptions
- Synthesis prompt output format: structured answer with sections for synthesis, contradictions, gaps
- Include few-shot examples in decomposition prompt for common patterns (research, analysis, review)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None (standalone prompt files)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6
- Parallel: true (no dependencies)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Prompt files created
- [ ] Prompts produce valid structured output when tested with LLM
- [ ] Follows existing framework prompt conventions
