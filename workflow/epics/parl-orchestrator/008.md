# Task: Examples — basic_research, deep_analysis, code_review

## Description
Create three example scripts demonstrating PARLOrchestrator usage across different use cases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `examples/parl_orchestrator/basic_research.py` — Wide search: fan out to multiple sub-agents researching different aspects of a topic
- [ ] `examples/parl_orchestrator/deep_analysis.py` — Deep analysis: decompose a complex analysis into parallel expert reviews
- [ ] `examples/parl_orchestrator/code_review.py` — Code review: parallel review of multiple files/modules
- [ ] Each example is self-contained and runnable
- [ ] Each example demonstrates key features: decomposition, parallel execution, result synthesis
- [ ] Examples include comments explaining what's happening at each stage

## Technical Details
- Directory: `examples/parl_orchestrator/`
- basic_research.py: Research a company — fan out to funding, reviews, pricing, team sub-agents
- deep_analysis.py: Analyze a topic from multiple angles — economic, social, technical
- code_review.py: Review code from multiple perspectives — security, performance, maintainability
- All examples use PARLOrchestrator directly and via SwarmRouter
- Show both simple usage and configuration options

## Dependencies
- [ ] 006 - PARLOrchestrator
- [ ] 007 - SwarmRouter integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6
- Parallel: true (can be written alongside tests)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Three example scripts created
- [ ] Each runs without errors (with valid API key)
- [ ] Examples demonstrate different decomposition patterns
