# Task: README update — Document new PARL orchestrator capability

## Description
Update the README to document the new PARLOrchestrator capability, including usage examples and configuration options.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Usage section added to README showing how to use PARLOrchestrator
- [ ] Configuration options documented (models, parallelism, timeouts, token budget)
- [ ] Quick-start code snippet
- [ ] Link to example scripts
- [ ] Architecture diagram or description of the orchestration flow

## Technical Details
- Modify: `README.md` — update the fork description section already added
- Add usage examples showing both direct PARLOrchestrator usage and SwarmRouter usage
- Document all constructor parameters with defaults
- Keep it concise — link to examples for detailed usage

## Dependencies
- [ ] 006 - PARLOrchestrator (need final API to document)
- [ ] 007 - SwarmRouter integration (need to document SwarmType usage)
- [ ] 008 - Examples (link to them from README)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: false (needs final API and examples)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] README updated with new section
- [ ] Code snippets are accurate and runnable
- [ ] All configuration options documented
