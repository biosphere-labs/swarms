# Task: README update — Document new PARL orchestrator capability

## Description
Update the README to document the new PARLOrchestrator capability, including usage examples and configuration options.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Usage section added to README showing how to use PARLOrchestrator
- [x] Configuration options documented (models, parallelism, timeouts, token budget)
- [x] Quick-start code snippet
- [x] Link to example scripts
- [x] Architecture diagram or description of the orchestration flow

## Technical Details
- Modify: `README.md` — update the fork description section already added
- Add usage examples showing both direct PARLOrchestrator usage and SwarmRouter usage
- Document all constructor parameters with defaults
- Keep it concise — link to examples for detailed usage

## Dependencies
- [x] 006 - PARLOrchestrator (final API documented)
- [x] 007 - SwarmRouter integration (SwarmType usage documented)
- [x] 008 - Examples (links added to README)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: false (needs final API and examples)

## Definition of Done
- [x] README updated with new section
- [x] Code snippets are accurate and runnable
- [x] All configuration options documented
